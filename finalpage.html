            <h1>And that's a year folks... A Whole Year!</h1>
            <h3>
                It's crazy to think that it has been a whole lap around the sun with you. Our journey has been full of life. Lots of ups and downs. Lots of heartfelt moments.
                I want you to know that I am the luckiest man on earth to be able to spend my time with you by my side. 
                You make the good days better, and the tough ones easier to bear.
                Your energy is contagious. Your heart is so pure... Everyday that I get to be with you, is a gift I never take for granted.
                Thank you for sharing your light with me, and being the best partner anyone could ever ask for. 
                You are the best thing that ever happened to me! 
                And I can't wait to celebrate many more years to come with you. 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Happy Anniversary My Love,
                I Love You with all my heart
